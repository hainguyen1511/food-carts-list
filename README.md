# Food Carts List
* Build a linear linked list of these food carts and display them to the user once done.

> [!TIP]
> I really enjoy the variety most of all food carts but the flavors available are so great. I will be keeping track of the userâ€™s favorite foods at the local food carts:
1. Name of the cart
2. Favorite food from that cart
3. Cost
4. A description of the flavors and what the user likes about this food

> [!CAUTION]
> My program will need to build a linear linked list of these food carts and display them to the user once done.

Follow this plan:

> [!CAUTION]
> Task 1. In a .h file, create a struct food cart with the five members. Use a dynamically allocated array (char *) for at least one of the members.

> [!CAUTION]
> Task 2. Add a struct node to your .h file
a. The data in a node should be a food cart object and a next pointer.

> [!CAUTION]
> Task 3. In My.cpp file, create a function to read in information from the user

> [!CAUTION]
> Task 4. Write a function to insert this information into a linear linked list
a. Start by inserting at the beginning
b. Extra Credit: Then, implement the task to insert the data in sorted order as it is being read in

> [!CAUTION]
> Task 5. Write another function to display all of the games.

> [!CAUTION]
> Task 6. Release all of the dynamic memory (destroying the LLL).
Other important items:
  1. All memory that is dynamically allocated needs to be released with delete when you are done.
  2. Make sure now to separate out your code into a .h file and .cpp files.
  3. You are not required to use classes in this assignment. But they MAY be used instead of the food cart struct
